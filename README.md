# Credit Risk Prediction (Loan Status: Yes/No)

This project predicts whether a **loan application should be approved (Yes)** or **rejected (No)** using a **Decision Tree (DT) Classifier**.  
The model analyzes key applicant details such as **income, credit history, loan amount, education, and property area** to make accurate predictions about loan eligibility.

## Key Steps

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and removed irrelevant columns (like `Loan_ID`)  
- **Feature Selection** – focused on important applicant and loan-related attributes  
- **Model Building** – implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier (DT)** using Scikit-learn  
- **Evaluation** – achieved **100% accuracy**, with perfect scores across all evaluation metrics  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1 Score
